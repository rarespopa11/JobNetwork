I've created a job networking system, with functions such as: creating new listings, modifying existing ones, deleting listings, viewing them, applying for jobs, viewing who applied for said jobs. All of this is done using two command line applications called App1 and App2. This project uses classes, derivation of classes, I/O File Handling and command line.
